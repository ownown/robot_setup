# Robot Setup

Setup script and instructions for the Lego Mindstorms/Raspberry Pi/Dexter Industries BrickPi3 robot.

The instructions in [`setup.md`](./setup.md) should guide you through setting up the Pi from scratch. [`setup.sh`](./setup.sh) is a script that automates a lot of the install and setup of things once you have an OS on the Pi and a network connection.
